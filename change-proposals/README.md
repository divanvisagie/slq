# Change Proposals

This directory contains proposals for features that have been considered but not yet implemented in the `slq` tool.

## Purpose

Change proposals serve to:
- Document features that were considered during development
- Provide detailed technical analysis of potential implementations
- Preserve design decisions and rationale for future reference
- Allow community discussion of proposed features

## Current Proposals

- [`journey-planning.md`](journey-planning.md) - Full journey planning functionality with route calculation and real-time integration

## Proposal Format

Each proposal should include:
- **Overview** - Brief description of the proposed feature
- **Current State** - What exists today (if anything)
- **Technical Requirements** - APIs, dependencies, complexity analysis
- **Implementation Plan** - Phased approach with clear milestones
- **Alternatives Considered** - Other approaches that were evaluated
- **Decision Points** - Key questions that need resolution

## Contributing Proposals

When adding new proposals:
1. Use descriptive filenames (e.g., `feature-name.md`)
2. Follow the established format for consistency
3. Include realistic implementation timelines
4. Consider backwards compatibility
5. Evaluate impact on existing functionality

## Status

Proposals in this directory are **not committed features**. They represent ideas that may be implemented in future versions if there is sufficient demand and development resources.

For implemented features, see the main [README.md](../README.md) and documentation.
